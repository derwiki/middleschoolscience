  Instead of drawing out the atoms and transferring the electrons from one atom to
  another, there is a simpler method. Write the involved atoms with their valence
  number:
#cross-multiply
  %div
    = atomic_notation('H', '+1')
    = atomic_notation('O', '-2')
  .cross= image_tag 'matter/cross.png'
  %div
    = atomic_notation('H', '', '2')
    = atomic_notation('O', '', '1')
%p
  And then just cross the valence number down to indicate the quantity of that
  element. Subscripts of '1' can be dropped, and the formula is written as: H
  %sub> 2
  O
%p
  This is a molecule of water. If we write 6 H
  %sub> 2
  O, that tells us that we have 6
  molecules of water. The number in front of the compound tells us how many
  molecules there are.
%p
  6 H
  %sub> 2
  O =&gt; 6 molecules
